# PM66xx-frequency-reference

The plan is to build a good 10MHz reference for a PM6674 frequency counter (and those that are related). 
This will be a gift to a lucky owner of such a counter. 

Inspiration (and physical measurements) are taken from [The sync channel](https://syncchannel.blogspot.com/2016/04/flukephilips-pm66xx-frequency-counter.html),
but I am not so sure about using the internal voltage reference of the oscillator module. I would rather use an external low tempco 
reference such as the [ADR434BRZ](https://www.analog.com/en/products/adr434.html).
